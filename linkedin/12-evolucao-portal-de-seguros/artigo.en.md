> **TL;DR:** Evolving a legacy portal without stopping the business.

## Problem

Customer, admin and registration portals running on traditional servers.

## Solution

Component by component: SPAs to S3 + CloudFront, APIs published on API Gateway via Terraform, services on EKS and a serverless database with backup. Every step reversible.

### Insurance portal evolution

1. DNS and WAF in front of everything.
2. Portals become SPAs on S3 + CloudFront.
3. APIs published on API Gateway via Terraform.
4. Services run on EKS.
5. Serverless MySQL, private network only.
6. Backup and snapshots with PRD guardrails.

## The code

```hcl
module "kms_key" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform.git//aws/kms-key"

  name_prefix             = local.name_prefix
  deletion_window_in_days = 7
  tags                    = local.tags
}

module "vpc" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform.git//aws/vpc"

  name_prefix        = local.name_prefix
  cidr_block         = "10.20.0.0/16"
  azs                = ["sa-east-1a", "sa-east-1b"]
  single_nat_gateway = true
  eks_cluster_name   = "demo-dev"
  tags               = local.tags
}
```

## Discussion

**Terraform modules used:** [aws/kms-key](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/kms-key), [aws/vpc](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/vpc), [aws/eks-cluster](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/eks-cluster), [aws/rds-instance](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/rds-instance), [aws/ecr](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/ecr), [aws/cloudfront-spa](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/aws/cloudfront-spa)

### FinOps: where the cost is

| Component | What drives cost | Lever |
|---|---|---|
| aws/eks-cluster | EKS nodes (EC2) and the per-cluster control plane | node autoscaling (Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler), Spot for tolerant workloads and Savings Plans for the baseline |
| aws/rds-instance | RDS instance class and Multi-AZ | right-size from real metrics, reserve PRD and stop HML/DEV after hours |
| aws/vpc | NAT Gateway per AZ and the traffic it processes | a single NAT in DEV and VPC endpoints for S3/ECR to keep traffic off the NAT |
| aws/cloudfront-spa | CDN data transfer | good caching and compression; the CDN usually lowers origin egress cost |

In the repository, aws/tag-compliance, aws/finops-cost-report, aws/cur-focus-export and aws/instance-scheduler close the loop: mandatory tags, cost report, CUR/FOCUS export and shutdown schedule.

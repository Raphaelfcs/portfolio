# Network sharing on Google Cloud

*Shared VPC and Network Connectivity Center as the equivalents of AWS Transit Gateway + RAM.*

> **TL;DR:** People coming from AWS always ask: what is the Transit Gateway of Google Cloud?

## Problem

Teams used to Transit Gateway + RAM needing to design the network on Google Cloud.

## Solution

Shared VPC handles sharing inside the organization; Network Connectivity Center acts as the hub when there are several VPCs or on-premises. Different models, not a 1:1 translation.

## The code

```hcl
module "project_foundation" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform.git//gcp/project-foundation"

  project_id       = "demo-plataforma-dev"
  project_name     = "Demo Plataforma"
  billing_account  = "000000-000000-000000"
  apis             = ["compute.googleapis.com", "container.googleapis.com", "sqladmin.googleapis.com"]
  boolean_policies = ["compute.skipDefaultNetworkCreation", "iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation", "storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess"]
  labels           = local.labels
}

module "vpc_network" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform.git//gcp/vpc-network"

  project_id = module.project_foundation.project_id
  region     = local.region
  subnet     = { name = "sn-gke-sp", cidr = "10.10.0.0/20", pods_cidr = "10.20.0.0/16", services_cidr = "10.30.0.0/20" }
  psa_range  = { address = "10.40.0.0", prefix_length = 16 }
}
```

## Discussion

**Terraform modules used:** [gcp/project-foundation](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/gcp/project-foundation), [gcp/vpc-network](https://github.com/Raphaelfcs/automacao_terraform/tree/main/gcp/vpc-network)

### FinOps: where the cost is

| Component | What drives cost | Lever |
|---|---|---|
| gcp/vpc-network | Cloud NAT and cross-zone/region traffic | Private Google Access and keep traffic in the same region |
| gcp/project-foundation | cost starts in projects without an owner | labels on every project (the module already applies them) and a budget alert in Billing |

The FinOps cycle I use (inform, optimize, operate) is drawn in the FinOps process lab in the repository.
